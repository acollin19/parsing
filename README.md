# parsing
Learning how to use shell script commands such as awk,sed,etc.
In this project, created a script wmetriks that parses through three txt files to produce different outputs
such as number of requests, IP addresses, product IDs. 
Counting the Product Id's and the count occurence of each then sorting them in descending order.
Second file rlogs runs the wmetriks file
